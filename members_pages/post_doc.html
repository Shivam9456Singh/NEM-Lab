      delectus dolores.Nanomaterials describe, in principle, materials of which
      a single unit is sized (in at least one dimension) between 1 and 100 nm
      (the usual definition of nanoscale[1]). Nanomaterials research takes a
      materials science-based approach to nanotechnology, leveraging advances in
      materials metrology and synthesis which have been developed in support of
      microfabrication research. Materials with structure at the nanoscale often
      have unique optical, electronic, thermo-physical or mechanical
      properties.[2][3][4] Nanomaterials are slowly becoming commercialized[5]
      and beginning to emerge as commodities.[6] Definition In ISO/TS 80004,
      nanomaterial is defined as the "material with any external dimension in
      the nanoscale or having internal structure or surface structure in the
      nanoscale", with nanoscale defined as the "length range approximately from
      1 nm to 100 nm". This includes both nano-objects, which are discrete
      pieces of material, and nanostructured materials, which have internal or
      surface structure on the nanoscale; a nanomaterial may be a member of both
      these categories.[7] On 18 October 2011, the European Commission adopted
      the following definition of a nanomaterial:[8] A natural, incidental or
      manufactured material containing particles, in an unbound state or as an
      aggregate or as an agglomerate and for 50% or more of the particles in the
      number size distribution, one or more external dimensions is in the size
      range 1 nm – 100 nm. In specific cases and where warranted by concerns for
      the environment, health, safety or competitiveness the number size
      distribution threshold of 50% may be replaced by a threshold between 1% to
      50%. Sources Engineered Engineered nanomaterials have been deliberately
      engineered and manufactured by humans to have certain required
      properties.[4][9] Legacy nanomaterials are those that were in commercial
      production prior to the development of nanotechnology as incremental
      advancements over other colloidal or particulate materials.[10][11][12]
      They include carbon black and titanium dioxide nanoparticles.[13]
      Incidental Nanomaterials may be unintentionally produced as a byproduct of
      mechanical or industrial processes through combustion and vaporization.
      Sources of incidental nanoparticles include vehicle engine exhausts,
      smelting, welding fumes, combustion processes from domestic solid fuel
      heating and cooking. For instance, the class of nanomaterials called
      fullerenes are generated by burning gas, biomass, and candle.[14] It can
      also be a byproduct of wear and corrosion products.[15] Incidental
      atmospheric nanoparticles are often referred to as ultrafine particles,
      which are unintentionally produced during an intentional operation, and
      could contribute to air pollution.[16][17] Natural Biological systems
      often feature natural, functional nanomaterials. The structure of
      foraminifera (mainly chalk) and viruses (protein, capsid), the wax
      crystals covering a lotus or nasturtium leaf, spider and spider-mite
      silk,[18] the blue hue of tarantulas,[19] the "spatulae" on the bottom of
      gecko feet, some butterfly wing scales, natural colloids (milk, blood),
      horny materials (skin, claws, beaks, feathers, horns, hair), paper,
      cotton, nacre, corals, and even our own bone matrix are all natural
      organic nanomaterials. Natural inorganic nanomaterials occur through
      crystal growth in the diverse chemical conditions of the Earth's crust.
      For example, clays display complex nanostructures due to anisotropy of
      their underlying crystal structure, and volcanic activity can give rise to
      opals, which are an instance of a naturally occurring photonic crystals
      due to their nanoscale structure. Fires represent particularly complex
      reactions and can produce pigments, cement, fumed silica etc. Natural
      sources of nanoparticles include combustion products forest fires,
      volcanic ash, ocean spray, and the radioactive decay of radon gas. Natural
      nanomaterials can also be formed through weathering processes of metal- or
      anion-containing rocks, as well as at acid mine drainage sites.[16]

      often categorized as to how many of their dimensions fall in the
      nanoscale. A nanoparticle is defined a nano-object with all three external
      dimensions in the nanoscale, whose longest and the shortest axes do not
      differ significantly. A nanofiber has two external dimensions in the
      nanoscale, with nanotubes being hollow nanofibers and nanorods being solid
      nanofibers. A nanoplate/nanosheet has one external dimension in the
      nanoscale,[20] and if the two larger dimensions are significantly
      different it is called a nanoribbon. For nanofibers and nanoplates, the
      other dimensions may or may not be in the nanoscale, but must be
      significantly larger. In all of these cases, a significant difference is
      noted to typically be at least a factor of 3.[21] Nanostructured materials
      are often categorized by what phases of matter they contain. A
      nanocomposite is a solid containing at least one physically or chemically
      distinct region or collection of regions, having at least one dimension in
      the nanoscale. A nanofoam has a liquid or solid matrix, filled with a
      gaseous phase, where one of the two phases has dimensions on the
      nanoscale. A nanoporous material is a solid material containing nanopores,
      voids in the form of open or closed pores of sub-micron lengthscales. A
      nanocrystalline material has a significant fraction of crystal grains in
      the nanoscale.[22] Nanoporous materials Main article: Nanoporous materials
      The term nanoporous materials contain subsets of microporous and
      mesoporous materials. Microporous materials are porous materials with a
      mean pore size smaller than 2 nm, while mesoporous materials are those
      with pores sizes in the region 2–50 nm.[23] Microporous materials exhibit
      pore sizes with comparable length-scale to small molecules. For this
      reason such materials may serve valuable applications including separation
      membranes. Mesoporous materials are interesting towards applications that
      require high specific surface areas, while enabling penetration for
      molecules that may be too large to enter the pores of a microporous
      material. In some sources, nanoporous materials and nanofoam are sometimes
      considered nanostructures but not nanomaterials because only the voids and
      not the materials themselves are nanoscale.[24] Although the ISO
      definition only considers round nano-objects to be nanoparticles, other
      sources use the term nanoparticle for all shapes.[25] Nanoparticles Main
      article: Nanoparticle Nanoparticles have all three dimensions on the
      nanoscale. Nanoparticles can also be embedded in a bulk solid to form a
      nanocomposite.[24] Fullerenes Main article: Fullerene The fullerenes are a
      class of allotropes of carbon which conceptually are graphene sheets
      rolled into tubes or spheres. These include the carbon nanotubes (or
      silicon nanotubes) which are of interest both because of their mechanical
      strength and also because of their electrical properties.[26] Rotating
      view of C60, one kind of fullerene The first fullerene molecule to be
      discovered, and the family's namesake, buckminsterfullerene (C60), was
      prepared in 1985 by Richard Smalley, Robert Curl, James Heath, Sean
      O'Brien, and Harold Kroto at Rice University. The name was a homage to
      Buckminster Fuller, whose geodesic domes it resembles. Fullerenes have
      since been found to occur in nature.[27] More recently, fullerenes have
      been detected in outer space.[28] For the past decade, the chemical and
      physical properties of fullerenes have been a hot topic in the field of
      research and development, and are likely to continue to be for a long
      time. In April 2003, fullerenes were under study for potential medicinal
      use: binding specific antibiotics to the structure of resistant bacteria
      and even target certain types of cancer cells such as melanoma. The
      October 2005 issue of Chemistry and Biology contains an article describing
      the use of fullerenes as light-activated antimicrobial agents. In the
      field of nanotechnology, heat resistance and superconductivity are among
      the properties attracting intense research. A common method used to
      produce fullerenes is to send a large current between two nearby graphite
      electrodes in an inert atmosphere. The resulting carbon plasma arc between
      the electrodes cools into sooty residue from which many fullerenes can be
      isolated. There are many calculations that have been done using ab-initio
      Quantum Methods applied to fullerenes. By DFT and TDDFT methods one can
      obtain IR, Raman, and UV spectra. Results of such calculations can be
      compared with experimental results. Metal-based nanoparticles Inorganic
      nanomaterials, (e.g. quantum dots, nanowires, and nanorods) because of
      their interesting optical and electrical properties, could be used in
      optoelectronics.[29] Furthermore, the optical and electronic properties of
      nanomaterials which depend on their size and shape can be tuned via
      synthetic techniques. There are the possibilities to use those materials
      in organic material based optoelectronic devices such as organic solar
      cells, OLEDs etc. The operating principles of such devices are governed by
      photoinduced processes like electron transfer and energy transfer. The
      performance of the devices depends on the efficiency of the photoinduced
      process responsible for their functioning. Therefore, better understanding
      of those photoinduced processes in organic/inorganic nanomaterial
      composite systems is necessary in order to use them in optoelectronic
      devices. Nanoparticles or nanocrystals made of metals, semiconductors, or
      oxides are of particular interest for their mechanical, electrical,
      magnetic, optical, chemical and other properties.[30][31] Nanoparticles
      have been used as quantum dots and as chemical catalysts such as
      nanomaterial-based catalysts. Recently, a range of nanoparticles are
      extensively investigated for biomedical applications including tissue
      engineering, drug delivery, biosensor.[32][33] Nanoparticles are of great
      scientific interest as they are effectively a bridge between bulk
      materials and atomic or molecular structures. A bulk material should have
      constant physical properties regardless of its size, but at the nano-scale
      this is often not the case. Size-dependent properties are observed such as
      quantum confinement in semiconductor particles, surface plasmon resonance
      in some metal particles, and superparamagnetism in magnetic materials.
      Nanoparticles exhibit a number of special properties relative to bulk
      material. For example, the bending of bulk copper (wire, ribbon, etc.)
      occurs with movement of copper atoms/clusters at about the 50 nm scale.
      Copper nanoparticles smaller than 50 nm are considered super hard
      materials that do not exhibit the same malleability and ductility as bulk
      copper. The change in properties is not always desirable. Ferroelectric
      materials smaller than 10 nm can switch their polarization direction using
      room temperature thermal energy, thus making them useless for memory
      storage. Suspensions of nanoparticles are possible because the interaction
      of the particle surface with the solvent is strong enough to overcome
      differences in density, which usually result in a material either sinking
      or floating in a liquid. Nanoparticles often have unexpected visual
      properties because they are small enough to confine their electrons and
      produce quantum effects. For example, gold nanoparticles appear deep red
      to black in solution. The often very high surface area to volume ratio of
      nanoparticles provides a tremendous driving force for diffusion,
      especially at elevated temperatures. Sintering is possible at lower
      temperatures and over shorter durations than for larger particles. This
      theoretically does not affect the density of the final product, though
      flow difficulties and the tendency of nanoparticles to agglomerate do
      complicate matters. The surface effects of nanoparticles also reduces the
      incipient melting temperature. One-dimensional nanostructures The smallest
      possible crystalline wires with cross-section as small as a single atom
      can be engineered in cylindrical confinement.[34][35][36] Carbon
      nanotubes, a natural semi-1D nanostructure, can be used as a template for
      synthesis. Confinement provides mechanical stabilization and prevents
      linear atomic chains from disintegration; other structures of 1D nanowires
      are predicted to be mechanically stable even upon isolation from the
      templates.[35][36] Two-dimensional nanostructures 2D materials are
      crystalline materials consisting of a two-dimensional single layer of
      atoms. The most important representative graphene was discovered in 2004.
      Thin films with nanoscale thicknesses are considered nanostructures, but
      are sometimes not considered nanomaterials because they do not exist
      separately from the substrate.[24][37] Bulk nanostructured materials Some
      bulk materials contain features on the nanoscale, including
      nanocomposites, nanocrystalline materials, nanostructured films, and
      nanotextured surfaces.[24] Box-shaped graphene (BSG) nanostructure is an
      example of 3D nanomaterial.[38] BSG nanostructure has appeared after
      mechanical cleavage of pyrolytic graphite. This nanostructure is a
      multilayer system of parallel hollow nanochannels located along the
      surface and having quadrangular cross-section. The thickness of the
      channel walls is approximately equal to 1 nm. The typical width of channel
      facets makes about 25 nm. Applications Main article: Applications of
      nanotechnology Nano materials are used in a variety of, manufacturing
      processes, products and healthcare including paints, filters, insulation
      and lubricant additives. In healthcare Nanozymes are nanomaterials with
      enzyme-like characteristics.[39] They are an emerging type of artificial
      enzyme, which have been used for wide applications in such as biosensing,
      bioimaging, tumor diagnosis,[40] antibiofouling and more. High quality
      filters may be produced using nanostructures, these filters are capable of
      removing particulate as small as a virus as seen in a water filter created
      by Seldon Technologies. Nanomaterials membrane bioreactor (NMs-MBR), the
      next generation of conventional MBR, are recently proposed for the
      advanced treatment of wastewater.[41] In the air purification field, nano
      technology was used to combat the spread of MERS in Saudi Arabian
      hospitals in 2012.[42] Nanomaterials are being used in modern and
      human-safe insulation technologies, in the past they were found in
      Asbestos-based insulation.[43] As a lubricant additive, nano materials
      have the ability to reduce friction in moving parts. Worn and corroded
      parts can also be repaired with self-assembling anisotropic nanoparticles
      called TriboTEX.[42] Nanomaterials have also been applied in a range of
      industries and consumer products. Mineral nanoparticles such as
      titanium-oxide have been used to improve UV protection in sunscreen. In
      the sports industry, lighter bats to have been produced with carbon
      nanotubes to improve performance. Another application is in the military,
      where mobile pigment nanoparticles have been used to create more effective
      camouflage. Nanomaterials can also be used in three-way-catalyst (TWC)
      applications. TWC converters have the advantage of controlling the
      emission of nitrogen oxides (NOx), which are precursors to acid rain and
      smog.[44] In core-shell structure, nanomaterials form shell as the
      catalyst support to protect the noble metals such as palladium and
      rhodium.[45] The primary function is that the supports can be used for
      carrying catalysts active components, making them highly dispersed,
      reducing the use of noble metals, enhancing catalysts activity, and
      improving the mechanical strength. Synthesis The goal of any synthetic
      method for nanomaterials is to yield a material that exhibits properties
      that are a result of their characteristic length scale being in the
      nanometer range (1 – 100 nm). Accordingly, the synthetic method should
      exhibit control of size in this range so that one property or another can
      be attained. Often the methods are divided into two main types, "bottom
      up" and "top down". Bottom-up methods Bottom-up methods involve the
      assembly of atoms or molecules into nanostructured arrays. In these
      methods the raw material sources can be in the form of gases, liquids, or
      solids. The latter require some sort of disassembly prior to their
      incorporation onto a nanostructure. Bottom up methods generally fall into
      two categories: chaotic and controlled. Chaotic processes involve
      elevating the constituent atoms or molecules to a chaotic state and then
      suddenly changing the conditions so as to make that state unstable.
      Through the clever manipulation of any number of parameters, products form
      largely as a result of the insuring kinetics. The collapse from the
      chaotic state can be difficult or impossible to control and so ensemble
      statistics often govern the resulting size distribution and average size.
      Accordingly, nanoparticle formation is controlled through manipulation of
      the end state of the products. Examples of chaotic processes are laser
      ablation,[46] exploding wire, arc, flame pyrolysis, combustion,[47] and
      precipitation synthesis techniques. Controlled processes involve the
      controlled delivery of the constituent atoms or molecules to the site(s)
      of nanoparticle formation such that the nanoparticle can grow to a
      prescribed sizes in a controlled manner. Generally the state of the
      constituent atoms or molecules are never far from that needed for
      nanoparticle formation. Accordingly, nanoparticle formation is controlled
      through the control of the state of the reactants. Examples of controlled
      processes are self-limiting growth solution, self-limited chemical vapor
      deposition, shaped pulse femtosecond laser techniques, plant and microbial
      approaches[48] and molecular beam epitaxy. Top-down methods Top-down
      methods adopt some 'force' (e. g. mechanical force, laser) to break bulk
      materials into nanoparticles. A popular method involves mechanical break
      apart bulk materials into nanomaterials is 'ball milling'. Besides,
      nanoparticles can also be made by laser ablation which apply short pulse
      lasers (e. g. femtosecond laser) to ablate a target (solid).[46]
      Characterization Main articles: Nanometrology and Characterization of
      nanoparticles Novel effects can occur in materials when structures are
      formed with sizes comparable to any one of many possible length scales,
      such as the de Broglie wavelength of electrons, or the optical wavelengths
      of high energy photons. In these cases quantum mechanical effects can
      dominate material properties. One example is quantum confinement where the
      electronic properties of solids are altered with great reductions in
      particle size. The optical properties of nanoparticles, e.g. fluorescence,
      also become a function of the particle diameter. This effect does not come
      into play by going from macrosocopic to micrometer dimensions, but becomes
      pronounced when the nanometer scale is reached. In addition to optical and
      electronic properties, the novel mechanical properties of many
      nanomaterials is the subject of nanomechanics research. When added to a
      bulk material, nanoparticles can strongly influence the mechanical
      properties of the material, such as the stiffness or elasticity. For
      example, traditional polymers can be reinforced by nanoparticles (such as
      carbon nanotubes) resulting in novel materials which can be used as
      lightweight replacements for metals. Such composite materials may enable a
      weight reduction accompanied by an increase in stability and improved
      functionality.[49] Finally, nanostructured materials with small particle
      size, such as zeolites and asbestos, are used as catalysts in a wide range
      of critical industrial chemical reactions. The further development of such
      catalysts can form the basis of more efficient, environmentally friendly
      chemical processes. The first observations and size measurements of
      nano-particles were made during the first decade of the 20th century.
      Zsigmondy made detailed studies of gold sols and other nanomaterials with
      sizes down to 10 nm and less. He published a book in 1914.[50] He used an
      ultramicroscope that employs a dark field method for seeing particles with
      sizes much less than light wavelength. There are traditional techniques
      developed during the 20th century in interface and colloid science for
      characterizing nanomaterials. These are widely used for first generation
      passive nanomaterials specified in the next section. These methods include
      several different techniques for characterizing particle size
      distribution. This characterization is imperative because many materials
      that are expected to be nano-sized are actually aggregated in solutions.
      Some of methods are based on light scattering. Others apply ultrasound,
      such as ultrasound attenuation spectroscopy for testing concentrated
      nano-dispersions and microemulsions.[51] There is also a group of
      traditional techniques for characterizing surface charge or zeta potential
      of nano-particles in solutions. This information is required for proper
      system stabilization, preventing its aggregation or flocculation. These
      methods include microelectrophoresis, electrophoretic light scattering,
      and electroacoustics. The last one, for instance colloid vibration current
      method is suitable for characterizing concentrated systems. Mechanical
      Properties The ongoing research has shown that mechanical properties can
      vary significantly in nanomaterials compared to bulk material.
      Nanomaterials have substantial mechanical properties due to the volume,
      surface, and quantum effects of nanoparticles. This is observed when the
      nanoparticles are added to common bulk material, the nanomaterial refines
      the grain and forms intergranular and intragranular structures which
      improve the grain boundaries and therefore the mechanical properties of
      the materials.[citation needed] Grain boundary refinements provide
      strengthening by increasing the stress required to cause intergranular or
      transgranular fractures. A common example where this can be observed is
      the addition of nano Silica to cement, which improves the tensile
      strength, compressive strength, and bending strength by the mechanisms
      just mentioned. The understanding of these properties will enhance the use
      of nanoparticles in novel applications in various fields such as surface
      engineering, tribology, nanomanufacturing, and nanofabrication. Techniques
      used: Steinitz in 1943 used the micro-indentation technique to test the
      hardness of microparticles, and now nanoindentation has been employed to
      measure elastic properties of particles at about 5-micron level.[52] These
      protocols are frequently used to calculate the mechanical characteristics
      of nanoparticles via atomic force microscopy (AFM) techniques. To measure
      the elastic modulus; indentation data is obtained via AFM
      force-displacement curves being converted to force-indentation curves.
      Hooke's law is used to determine the cantilever deformation and depth of
      the tip, and in conclusion, the pressure equation can be written as:[53]
      P=k (ẟc - ẟc0) [54] ẟc : cantilever deformation ẟc0 : deflection ofset AFM
      allows us to obtain a high-resolution image of multiple types of surfaces
      while the tip of the cantilever can be used to obtain information about
      mechanical properties. Computer simulations are also being progressively
      used to test theories and complement experimental studies. The most used
      computer method is molecular dynamics simulation,[55] which uses newton's
      equations of motion for the atoms or molecules in the system. Other
      techniques such direct probe method are used to determine the adhesive
      properties of nanomaterials. Both the technique and simulation are coupled
      with transmission electron microscope (TEM) and AFM techniques to provide
      results. Mechanical properties of common nanomaterials classes:
      Crystalline metal nanomaterials: Dislocations are one of the major
      contributors toward elastic properties within nanomaterials similar to
      bulk crystalline materials. Despite the traditional view of there being no
      dislocations in nanomaterials. Ramos,[56] experimental work has shown that
      the hardness of gold nanoparticles is much higher than their bulk
      counterparts, as there are stacking faults and dislocations forming that
      activate multiple strengthening mechanisms in the material. Through these
      experiments, more research has shown that via nanoindentation
      techniques,[57] material strength; compressive stress, increases under
      compression with decreasing particle size, because of nucleating
      dislocations. These dislocations have been observed using TEM techniques,
      coupled with nanoindentation. Silicon nanoparticles strength and hardness
      are four times more than the value of the bulk material.[54] The
      resistance to pressure applied can be attributed to the line defects
      inside the particles as well as a dislocation that provides strengthening
      of the mechanical properties of the nanomaterial. Furthermore, the
      addition of nanoparticles strengthens a matrix because the pinning of
      particles inhibits grain growth. This refines the grain, and hence
      improves the mechanical properties.[52] However, not all additions of
      nanomaterials lead to an increase in properties for example nano-Cu. But
      this is attributed to the inherent properties of the material being weaker
      than the matrix. Nonmetallic nanoparticles and nanomaterials:
      Size-dependent behavior of mechanical properties is still not clear in the
      case of polymer nanomaterials however, in one research by Lahouij they
      found that the compressive moduli of polystyrene nanoparticles were found
      to be less than that of the bulk counterparts. This can be associated with
      the functional groups being hydrated.[58] Furthermore, nonmetallic
      nanomaterials can lead to agglomerates forming inside the matrix they are
      being added to and hence decrease the mechanical properties by leading to
      fracture under even low mechanical loads, such as the addition of CNTs.
      The agglomerates will act as slip planes as well as planes in which cracks
      can easily propagate (9). However, most organic nanomaterials are flexible
      and these and the mechanical properties such as hardness etc. are not
      dominant.[58] Nanowires and nanotubes: The elastic moduli of some
      nanowires namely lead and silver, decrease with increasing diameter. This
      has been associated with surface stress, oxidation layer, and surface
      roughness.[59] However, the elastic behavior of ZnO nanowires does not get
      affected by surface effects but their fracture properties do. So, it is
      generally dependent on material behavior and their bonding as well.[60]
      The reason why mechanical properties of nanomaterials are still a hot
      topic for research is that measuring the mechanical properties of
      individual nanoparticles is a complicated method, involving multiple
      control factors. Nonetheless, Atomic force microscopy has been widely used
      to measure the mechanical properties of nanomaterials. Adhesion and
      friction of nanoparticles When talking about the application of a material
      adhesion and friction play a critical role in determining the outcome of
      the application. Therefore, it is critical to see how these properties
      also get affected by the size of a material. Again, AFM is a technique
      most used to measure these properties and to determine the adhesive
      strength of nanoparticles to any solid surface, along with the colloidal
      probe technique and other chemical properties.[61] Furthermore, the forces
      playing a role in providing these adhesive properties to nanomaterials are
      either the electrostatic forces, VdW, capillary forces, solvation forces,
      structure force, etc. It has been found that the addition of nanomaterials
      in bulk materials substantially increases their adhesive capabilities by
      increasing their strength through various bonding mechanisms.[62]
      Nanomaterials dimension approaches zero, which means that the fraction of
      the particle's surface to overall atoms increases. Along with surface
      effects, the movement of nanoparticles also plays a role in dictating
      their mechanical properties such as shearing capabilities. The movement of
      particles can be observed under TEM. For example, the movement behavior of
      MoS2 [63] nanoparticles dynamic contact was directly observed in situ
      which led to the conclusion that fullerenes can shear via rolling or
      sliding. However, observing these properties is again a very complicated
      process due to multiple contributing factors. Applications specific to
      Mechanical Properties:[64] Lubrication Nano-manufacturing Coatings
      Uniformity The chemical processing and synthesis of high performance
      technological components for the private, industrial and military sectors
      requires the use of high purity ceramics, polymera, glass-ceramics, and
      composite materials. In condensed bodies formed from fine powders, the
      irregular sizes and shapes of nanoparticles in a typical powder often lead
      to non-uniform packing morphologies that result in packing density
      variations in the powder compact. Uncontrolled agglomeration of powders
      due to attractive van der Waals forces can also give rise to in
      microstructural inhomogeneities. Differential stresses that develop as a
      result of non-uniform drying shrinkage are directly related to the rate at
      which the solvent can be removed, and thus highly dependent upon the
      distribution of porosity. Such stresses have been associated with a
      plastic-to-brittle transition in consolidated bodies, and can yield to
      crack propagation in the unfired body if not relieved.[65][66][67] In
      addition, any fluctuations in packing density in the compact as it is
      prepared for the kiln are often amplified during the sintering process,
      yielding inhomogeneous densification. Some pores and other structural
      defects associated with density variations have been shown to play a
      detrimental role in the sintering process by growing and thus limiting
      end-point densities. Differential stresses arising from inhomogeneous
      densification have also been shown to result in the propagation of
      internal cracks, thus becoming the strength-controlling flaws.[68][69] It
      would therefore appear desirable to process a material in such a way that
      it is physically uniform with regard to the distribution of components and
      porosity, rather than using particle size distributions which will
      maximize the green density. The containment of a uniformly dispersed
      assembly of strongly interacting particles in suspension requires total
      control over particle-particle interactions. A number of dispersants such
      as ammonium citrate (aqueous) and imidazoline or oleyl alcohol
      (nonaqueous) are promising solutions as possible additives for enhanced
      dispersion and deagglomeration. Monodisperse nanoparticles and colloids
      provide this potential.[70] Monodisperse powders of colloidal silica, for
      example, may therefore be stabilized sufficiently to ensure a high degree
      of order in the colloidal crystal or polycrystalline colloidal solid which
      results from aggregation. The degree of order appears to be limited by the
      time and space allowed for longer-range correlations to be established.
      Such defective polycrystalline colloidal structures would appear to be the
      basic elements of sub-micrometer colloidal materials science, and,
      therefore, provide the first step in developing a more rigorous
      understanding of the mechanisms involved in microstructural evolution in
      high performance materials and components.[71][72] Nanomaterials in
      articles, patents, and products The quantitative analysis of nanomaterials
      showed that nanoparticles, nanotubes, nanocrystalline materials,
      nanocomposites, and graphene have been mentioned in 400,000, 181,000,
      144,000, 140,000, and 119,000 ISI-indexed articles, respectively, by
      September 2018. As far as patents are concerned, nanoparticles, nanotubes,
      nanocomposites, graphene, and nanowires have been played a role in 45,600,
      32,100, 12,700, 12,500, and 11,800 patents, respectively. Monitoring
      approximately 7,000 commercial nano-based products available on global
      markets revealed that the properties of around 2,330 products have been
      enabled or enhanced aided by nanoparticles. Liposomes, nanofibers,
      nanocolloids, and aerogels were also of the most common nanomaterials in
      consumer products.[73] The European Union Observatory for Nanomaterials
      (EUON) has produced a database (NanoData) that provides information on
      specific patents, products, and research publications on nanomaterials.
      Health and safety Main article: Health and safety hazards of nanomaterials
      World Health Organization guidelines The World Health Organization (WHO)
      published a guideline on protecting workers from potential risk of
      manufactured nanomaterials at the end of 2017.[74] WHO used a
      precautionary approach as one of its guiding principles. This means that
      exposure has to be reduced, despite uncertainty about the adverse health
      effects, when there are reasonable indications to do so. This is
      highlighted by recent scientific studies that demonstrate a capability of
      nanoparticles to cross cell barriers and interact with cellular
      structures.[75][76] In addition, the hierarchy of controls was an
      important guiding principle. This means that when there is a choice
      between control measures, those measures that are closer to the root of
      the problem should always be preferred over measures that put a greater
      burden on workers, such as the use of personal protective equipment (PPE).
      WHO commissioned systematic reviews for all important issues to assess the
      current state of the science and to inform the recommendations according
      to the process set out in the WHO Handbook for guideline development. The
      recommendations were rated as "strong" or "conditional" depending on the
      quality of the scientific evidence, values and preferences, and costs
      related to the recommendation. The WHO guidelines contain the following
      recommendations for safe handling of manufactured nanomaterials (MNMs) A.
      Assess health hazards of MNMs WHO recommends assigning hazard classes to
      all MNMs according to the Globally Harmonized System (GHS) of
      Classification and Labelling of Chemicals for use in safety data sheets.
      For a limited number of MNMs this information is made available in the
      guidelines (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). WHO
      recommends updating safety data sheets with MNM-specific hazard
      information or indicating which toxicological end-points did not have
      adequate testing available (strong recommendation, moderate-quality
      evidence). For the respirable fibres and granular biopersistent particles'
      groups, the GDG suggests using the available classification of MNMs for
      provisional classification of nanomaterials of the same group (conditional
      recommendation, low-quality evidence). B. Assess exposure to MNMs WHO
      suggests assessing workers' exposure in workplaces with methods similar to
      those used for the proposed specific occupational exposure limit (OEL)
      value of the MNM (conditional recommendation, low-quality evidence).
      Because there are no specific regulatory OEL values for MNMs in
      workplaces, WHO suggests assessing whether workplace exposure exceeds a
      proposed OEL value for the MNM. A list of proposed OEL values is provided
      in an annex of the guidelines. The chosen OEL should be at least as
      protective as a legally mandated OEL for the bulk form of the material
      (conditional recommendation, low-quality evidence). If specific OELs for
      MNMs are not available in workplaces, WHO suggests a step-wise approach
      for inhalation exposure with, first an assessment of the potential for
      exposure; second, conducting basic exposure assessment and third,
      conducting a comprehensive exposure assessment such as those proposed by
      the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) or Comité
      Européen de Normalisation (the European Committee for Standardization,
      CEN) (conditional recommendation, moderate quality evidence). For dermal
      exposure assessment, WHO found that there was insufficient evidence to
      recommend one method of dermal exposure assessment over another. C.
      Control exposure to MNMs Based on a precautionary approach, WHO recommends
      focusing control of exposure on preventing inhalation exposure with the
      aim of reducing it as much as possible (strong recommendation,
      moderate-quality evidence). WHO recommends reduction of exposures to a
      range of MNMs that have been consistently measured in workplaces
      especially during cleaning and maintenance, collecting material from
      reaction vessels and feeding MNMs into the production process. In the
      absence of toxicological information, WHO recommends implementing the
      highest level of controls to prevent workers from any exposure. When more
      information is available, WHO recommends taking a more tailored approach
      (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). WHO recommends taking
      control measures based on the principle of hierarchy of controls, meaning
      that the first control measure should be to eliminate the source of
      exposure before implementing control measures that are more dependent on
      worker involvement, with PPE being used only as a last resort. According
      to this principle, engineering controls should be used when there is a
      high level of inhalation exposure or when there is no, or very little,
      toxicological information available. In the absence of appropriate
      engineering controls PPE should be used, especially respiratory
      protection, as part of a respiratory protection programme that includes
      fit-testing (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). WHO
      suggests preventing dermal exposure by occupational hygiene measures such
      as surface cleaning, and the use of appropriate gloves (conditional
      recommendation, low quality evidence). When assessment and measurement by
      a workplace safety expert is not available, WHO suggests using control
      banding for nanomaterials to select exposure control measures in the
      workplace. Owing to a lack of studies, WHO cannot recommend one method of
      control banding over another (conditional recommendation, very low-quality
      evidence). For health surveillance WHO could not make a recommendation for
      targeted MNM-specific health surveillance programmes over existing health
      surveillance programmes that are already in use owing to the lack of
      evidence. WHO considers training of workers and worker involvement in
      health and safety issues to be best practice but could not recommend one
      form of training of workers over another, or one form of worker
      involvement over another, owing to the lack of studies available. It is
      expected that there will be considerable progress in validated measurement
      methods and risk assessment and WHO expects to update these guidelines in
      five years' time, in 2022.[needs update] Other guidance Because
      nanotechnology is a recent development, the health and safety effects of
      exposures to nanomaterials, and what levels of exposure may be acceptable,
      are subjects of ongoing research.[9] Of the possible hazards, inhalation
      exposure appears to present the most concern. Animal studies indicate that
      carbon nanotubes and carbon nanofibers can cause pulmonary effects
      including inflammation, granulomas, and pulmonary fibrosis, which were of
      similar or greater potency when compared with other known fibrogenic
      materials such as silica, asbestos, and ultrafine carbon black. Acute
      inhalation exposure of healthy animals to biodegradable inorganic
      nanomaterials have not demonstrated significant toxicity effects.[77]
      Although the extent to which animal data may predict clinically
      significant lung effects in workers is not known, the toxicity seen in the
      short-term animal studies indicate a need for protective action for
      workers exposed to these nanomaterials, although no reports of actual
      adverse health effects in workers using or producing these nanomaterials
      were known as of 2013.[78] Additional concerns include skin contact and
      ingestion exposure,[78][79][80] and dust explosion hazards.[81][82]
      Elimination and substitution are the most desirable approaches to hazard
      control. While the nanomaterials themselves often cannot be eliminated or
      substituted with conventional materials,[9] it may be possible to choose
      properties of the nanoparticle such as size, shape, functionalization,
      surface charge, solubility, agglomeration, and aggregation state to
      improve their toxicological properties while retaining the desired
      functionality.[83] Handling procedures can also be improved, for example,
      using a nanomaterial slurry or suspension in a liquid solvent instead of a
      dry powder will reduce dust exposure.[9] Engineering controls are physical
      changes to the workplace that isolate workers from hazards, mainly
      ventilation systems such as fume hoods, gloveboxes, biosafety cabinets,
      and vented balance enclosures.[84] Administrative controls are changes to
      workers' behavior to mitigate a hazard, including training on best
      practices for safe handling, storage, and disposal of nanomaterials,
      proper awareness of hazards through labeling and warning signage, and
      encouraging a general safety culture. Personal protective equipment must
      be worn on the worker's body and is the least desirable option for
      controlling hazards.[9] Personal protective equipment normally used for
      typical chemicals are also appropriate for nanomaterials, including long
      pants, long-sleeve shirts, and closed-toed shoes, and the use of safety
      gloves, goggles, and impervious laboratory coats.[84] In some
      circumstances respirators may be used.[83]
