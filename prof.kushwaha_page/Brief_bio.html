      Dr. Ajay was born in Kanpur, a large industrial city located at
      central-western part of Uttar Pradesh, India. He received the Bachelor
      of Science (B.Sc.-Physics & Mathematics) and Master of Science (M.Sc.)
      in Physics with specialization in Electronics from Chhatrapati Shahu Ji
      Maharaj University, formerly Kanpur University, Uttar Pradesh, India.
      Then, he worked as ‘Lecturer of Physics’ in engineering colleges
      affiliated to Uttar Pradesh Technical University, Lucknow.
      <br />
      <br />
      In 2008, Dr. Ajay moved to Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (IITB)
      (www.iitb.ac.in), Mumbai, Maharashtra, India to pursue his doctoral
      research. He joined ‘Nanomaterials Research Laboratory’ led by Prof M.
      Aslam at Department of Physics, IIT Bombay and received Ph.D. degree in
      area of Nanomaterials. His thesis work was mainly dedicated to
      controlled growth of nanostructures and tailoring of surface defects.
      Dr. Ajay’s PhD thesis is entitled as “Control over electrical and
      photoelectrical properties of ZnO nanowire films by defect manipulation
      and surface functionalization.”
      <br />
      <br />
      After PhD, he joined as SCIENTIST-I’ at ‘Institute of Materials Research
      and Engineering (IMRE) Singapore (https://www.a-star.edu.sg/imre), IMRE
      is a public funded research institute of the Science and Engineering
      Research Council (SERC), Agency for Science, Technology and Research
      (A*STAR). During stay at IMRE, he worked on metal oxide functional
      coatings to develop smart windows & electrochromic glasses for green
      buildings. He received DST-INSPIRE Faculty Fellow Award in year 2016
      from Department of Science and Technology, Govt. of India. Then, he
      joined the Department of Metallurgical Engineering and Materials Science
      at IIT Indore as INSPIRE Faculty in July 2016 and as Assistant Professor
      in September-2017. He is the recipient of SERB-Early Career Research
      Award (2017) from Government of India.
